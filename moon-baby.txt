Let's take a blast to the moon baby
I sit around wishing you well
how I'm craving you, yeah!
Every time I'm near you
I always wanna swallow you down
I'll be right here if ya' need me
In my life, I'll need you here, don't ask why
I'll never disappear
why is it everyday that I feel the pain?
Let's take a trip to the stars far away
where were you when I was down?
Staring into the dead
my pain is caused by my pleasure
my soul mate lives in your body
I can't get you out of my head
It never goes away
In my life I'll need you here, don't ask why
I'll never disappear
In your eyes you can bid me farwell
but don't ever try to understand the situation
why is it everyday that I feel the pain?
It always comes when I least expect it
when I'm looking for love
always seem to be regretting it
Why is it everyday that I feel the pain?

I CANT GET YOU OUT OF MY HEADDDDD IYT NEVER GOES AWAY
